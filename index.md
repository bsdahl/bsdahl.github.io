## Hello I'm Benjamin Dahl
<hr class="line-title-left">
#### Web Developer, Tech enthusiast in Ventura County California

I am a man of many skills, but my passion is web development. My journey began in high school when I taught myself HTML and CSS. Shortly after, I landed my first job as a Webmaster at a two year Bible-college in Minnesota. I continued my work as a web developer both professionally and as a freelancer throughout college as I studied Computer Science for two years and then transferred to Liberty University to complete a *B.S. in Business Management Information Systems: Web Development.* I chose to study BMIS because while I loved computer science I felt that I would need more than programming skills to be successful in life. 

Aside from programming in and web development, I've also worked in I.T. and Radio Broadcasting. I have a General Class Ham Radio license and enjoy working with DIY electronics. Occasionally, I design and build small business networks including enterprise wireless, routing, switching, and even pulling cable. 

I believe I am different than most people in my field, because I love both technology and I love people. People say that they enjoy working with me and that I am a good teacher. Having just completed my Bachelors degree in May of 2017, I am looking forward to finding a full-time job as a Web developer and working on meaningful applications.

In Spring of 2010 I was hired by the Association Free Lutheran Bible School as the new Webmaster. My job was to update and maintain the existing Joomla site. I worked at AFLBS until 2011 when I left to work in Alaska. I later returned to AFLBS as the Web Developer & Administrator in 2013, working remotely. During my time working for AFLBS I designed and launched 3 different designs for aflbs.org. Pictured is the most recent redesign in 2014.

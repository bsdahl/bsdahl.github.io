I built this multi-page application for AFLBS when the staff asked me if there was a better way of keeping track of student interactions. I first designed the data model using MySQL and then built a php application using AngularJS. The app is highly interactive using AJAX requests to the backend API to deliver data in JSON. The app is also mobile friendly.

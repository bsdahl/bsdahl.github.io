This was one of my favorite client redesigns. Brush Arbor is a local artist in Ventura county who found fame and success in the 1970s and 1980s. Recently they are making a come back and wanted a new website to feature there latest album. I built the site in WordPress and was particularly proud of the front page *click to play* button that will toggle an audio preview of their music and greeting.

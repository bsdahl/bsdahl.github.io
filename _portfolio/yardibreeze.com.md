My biggest project at Yardi was developing a marketing website for a brand new property management software called Yardi Breeze. I worked with a crack team of content creators, marketing writers, and a talented graphic designer to design a website. I then took those designs and built a custom WordPress theme using the Roots.io Sage theme development framework and UIkit framework. I also built a few custom WordPress plugins, including one that interfaced with the Goto Webinars API to pull sales webinars into an events page.

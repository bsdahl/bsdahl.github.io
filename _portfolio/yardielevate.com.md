One interesting project that I had while working at Yardi, was to develop a custom product page in WordPress that would have an entirely different theme and style. The solution, was to build a WordPress plugin that injected a custom page template into WordPress. That page template would strip away all of the main theme assets and instead enqueue its own, just for that page. The result was a beautiful marketing page that highlighted a new Yardi product, while still living within the www.yardi.com marketing site.

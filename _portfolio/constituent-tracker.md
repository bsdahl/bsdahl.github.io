This was one of my first attempts at building an entire one-page database driven app from start to finish. At the time I was studying PHP and MySQL in school and so I wrote the entire app using those technologies as well as the Google Maps API. The app was used by recruiters to track their recent contacts with constituents on a map. Map icons were colored based on the most recent contact.
